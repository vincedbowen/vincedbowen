Hello ãƒ„ 

I am a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Biomedical Engineering. This past spring, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Currently, I am extremely passionate about using technology and software to solve challenges in our healthcare and medical system. I'm interning at The Cigna Group, where I have the opportunity to work on exactly that!

During my free time, I enjoy training my dog, getting outdoors, and listening to music!
