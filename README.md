I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder, and will be graduating with both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in Computer Science in May 2026.

Currently, I am extremely passionate about using technology and software to solve challenges in our healthcare and medical system. I just completed an internship at The Cigna Group, where I had the opportunity to work on exactly that!

During my free time, I enjoy cycling, getting outdoors, and listening to music!
